## Introduction
This project uses an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** network with TensorFlow to classify IMDB movie reviews as either positive or negative. The model is trained on the IMDB dataset and can predict sentiment for new reviews.

âœ… Deep Learning-based Sentiment Classifier  
âœ… Trained on 25,000 IMDB reviews  
âœ… Uses word embeddings for text understanding  
âœ… Custom review sentiment prediction  

---

## Key Features
- âœ… **IMDB dataset** (preprocessed into sequences)  
- âœ… **LSTM for sentiment classification**  
- âœ… **Visualizes training performance** (accuracy & loss)  
- âœ… Allows **custom review sentiment prediction**

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Improvements
- âœ… Use **Bidirectional LSTM** for better context understanding.
- âœ… Implement **Pretrained Word Embeddings** (e.g., GloVe, Word2Vec).
- âœ… Create a **Web App Interface** for easy review testing.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DilshanaRanawake/SentimentAnalyzer-TF.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the IMDB dataset or use the preprocessed version included.
2. Run the model training script:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
3. After training, input the `sentiment_model.h5` file (output of the `train_model.py`) into the `predict_sentiment.py` and run it:
4. Alternatively, use the prediction script for custom sentiment analysis directly by inputting a review:
    ```bash
    python predict_sentiment.py "Your movie review text here."
    ```
